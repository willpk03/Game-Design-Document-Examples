<h3> My Experience with Game Design</h3>
I've been fortunate to have a vast amount of experience. Fortunately I've been able to lead Game Design for Minecraft Servers of large youtubers and work along side other team members at Awesome Black to develop the Game Design Document their and leading the technical parts. With my Game Design documents I work to be able to communicate in ways to aid the developers in understanding the ideas and how they could be developed. While also making sure that the ideas I present have clear explainations on not only how they would work but also why. Below are two examples of Minecraft Game Design Documents as I can not share the document I worked on at Awesome Black:
